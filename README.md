## My First Web Development Project - IB ITGS Internal Assessment

### Description 
This website represents my first venture into web development, created as an Internal Assessment project for the International Baccalaureate (IB) Information Technology in a Global Society (ITGS) course. It's a static HTML website that showcases my early understanding of web technologies and development practices.

The website serves as a digital platform hosting my spanish professor's content pages. What makes this project particularly interesting is its preservation of history - the `/old/` directory contains the original versions of the pages, providing a fascinating glimpse into the initial development stages and showing how the site evolved over time.

This project holds special significance as it marks the beginning of my journey in web development, laying the foundation for my future projects and technical growth.

### Results 
The project successfully fulfilled its requirements as an IB ITGS Internal Assessment, demonstrating fundamental web development concepts and practical implementation of static web technologies.
